# Crestron module for CommandFusion via Crestron Mobile Symbol

This project allows iViewer to communicate with a Crestron processor using the native Crestron Mobile symbol in your SIMPL projects.
This offers far better Ethernet reliability than using TCP Server via SIMPL+, which the original iViewer Server SIMPL+ module was forced to use.

## Requirements

1. iViewer 4 or newer (with JavaScript support)
2. Crestron processor with firmware v??
